        <h2>About Plenty of Geeks</h2>
             
        <p><strong>Plenty of Geeks is a medium used to connect Game Designers and Game Programmers</strong></p>
    
    <p>Often many Game Designers have great video game ideas that go un-pursued 
        due to the lack of Programmer resources. The resources available are typically 
        unsuited for small groups or organizations who are looking for not just a generic
        code monkey but rather inspired individuals who share a passion for Game Design.</p>
        
        <p>Plenty of Geeks allows users to post a game project via our Posts page.
        Here any user may view this project and leave comments, share thoughts
        and offer their support towards the project. </p>
        
        <p>Users wanting to post a Game Project idea have the option of creating a
        "Party Quest" posting. The poster, or leader, will be able to allocate a
        specified amount of slots to allow for other users to join the project.
        The leader can pick from the available users who show interest in being 
        apart of the development to be apart of the project. As users are added
        to this project team or "Party" the slots fill up, allowing for other users
        to be aware of how many other users are helping this project become a reality.</p>
        
        <p>This way users can aquire a team of ideal minds for the creation of a 
        video game quickly and directly. </p>
        
        <p>Additionally, users have the option of posting a game idea for the purpose
        of publishing the idea to the public. This way, if a user has no knowledge
        of video game programming but wishes to see a video game created, they can
        expose their idea to those with the power to bring that game to life.</p>
        
        <p>All posts have a vote element, up vote and down vote. To insure the quality
        of the ideas and projects released here, every post has a threshold to which
        it can be down voted, once this threshold is reached the post is deleted.</p>
        
        <h3>About our users </h3>
        
        <p>Each user profile contains that users "Job Class"
        this simply illustrates whether they are purely a game designer,
        a game programmer, or both. Game designers may or may not have any 
        previous programming background, these users are seen as to provide
        the ideas behind a video game while the game programmers are seen to
        construct the underlying foundation for the game to be functional.
        </p>
        
        <p>Users who will both be conjuring video game ideas and programming
        the implementation of game Project ideas fall under both categories
        Game Designer and Game Programmer.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Everyone is Welcome </strong> </p>
        <p>Game Designers, Game Programmers, storyboard writers, pixel artists,
        3D modelers, animators, even if you know nothing about computer programming
        and all you want to do is share a great video game idea</p>
        <p><strong>This is the place for you </strong></p>
