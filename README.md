# ProjectWebapp
A website to match Game Designer's project with Programmers.

IDEA:
  make the theme kind of like the FF Tactics Advanced Bar, where you go there and there are like "job postings" to go kill monsters and what not except for our site it should be "Game Idea Postings" or something, we should make up our own little name for these postings. But i suppose we could keep it very simple and elegent, one type of posting
  
  the posting will be a game idea or project pitch, simply put it could relatively be 1 of 2 things
  
  someone posting a game idea, nothing more. anyone can take the idea and run with it, its just a means of getting an idea out there.
  
  someone posting a game project, an idea for a game and slots for the "party members"
  this posting's intention will be to get programmers to join this quest, the original poster will be able to
  choose who they want in for the project and as they choose the slots will fill up until it is full and the posting
  becomes closed.
  
  each post should have features such as:
                commenting
                votes (up vote or down vote)
                follow/sign up (user is notified via whatever when there is activity on the post)
                image posting
                
  As mentioned above, there should be the ability to create a project posting that has slots for available party members, and the original poster should have the ability to choose and add different users to the project
  
  
  The types of user profiles:
                    Programmer
                    Game Designer
                    Both
